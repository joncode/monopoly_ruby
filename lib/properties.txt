roll program 

if you roll a double you roll again , therefore game.next_turn is not run
  doubles is incremented instead
  if you doubles 3x you go to jail

if you are in jail you must roll doubles to get out or post bail



turn loop 
	get_menu
end

end turn situations
	normal end turn - no doubles after do_location
		get_menu w/ end turn
	normal end turn - doubles rolled when in jail
		do_location of roll value
		get_menu w/ end turn
	abnormal end turn - go_to_jail location, 3rd doubles
		no get menu , just you are in jail msg
	in_jail - didnt roll doubles
		menu with post bail option ??
	loop re-runs
		something besides roll was chosen 
		doubles were rolled when not in jail 
			@doubles += 1\
			
begin turn situations
	normal begin turn - doubles havent been rolled
		get_menu w/ roll
	in_jail begin turn
		get_menu w/ roll , post, card?
